# Gungnir UI

UI helpers for the [Gungnir](https://www.github.com/kwrooijen/gungnir) library

## Installation

Gungnir is still in its design phase and can result in breaking changes while on
the SNAPSHOT version. Any breaking changes will be reflected in the updated
documentation.

Add the following dependencies to your `project.clj`

```clojure
:dependencies [[kwrooijen/gungnir "0.0.1-SNAPSHOT"]
               [kwrooijen/gungnir.ui "0.0.1-SNAPSHOT"]
               ,,,]
```

## Form

Gungnir Models and Changesets can be used for form validation. A real world
example would be to have a user registration form.
